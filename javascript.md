## Introduction to Javascript

### Data Types

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null: represents the intentional absence of a value. represented by the keyword **null**\(without quotes\).
5. Undefined: also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null. denoted by the keyword **undefined**\(without quotes\).
6. Symbol: A newer feature to the language. unique identifiers, useful  in more complelx coding. 
7. Object: Collections of related data. 

### Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an **instance** of the data type. Every string instance has a **property** called _length_ that stores the number of characters in that string. 

### Methods

* Methods are actions we can perform. Javascript provides a number of string methods. 
* When we use **console.log\(\)** we're calling the **.log\(\)** method on the **console** object. 
* You can find a list of **built-in-string methods**: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global\_Objects/String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
